## Project Description
My final project's goal is to deepen our understanding of how different rhetorical strategies and types of language affect public perception of important issues like climate change. By analyzing various forms of rhetoric in climate change-focused articles, this project can reveal divides in how climate change is percieved and acted upon, ultimately promoting a more informed and unified approach to addressing environmental issues.

## Research Question
*In what ways have rhetorical strategies been used in written works about climate change, and what can exploratory data analysis of sentimental language reveal about the presence of propaganda versus scientifically backed information in reputable publications?*
