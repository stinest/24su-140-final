    "In the complex fight against climate change, effective communication is key. Understanding how different rhetoric is used to shape public perception and spur action can make all the difference. I want to find which types of language are most indicative of propaganda versus scientifically backed information to gauge their influence on public understanding of climate change.\n",

My research intends to break these divisions and instead promote a more informed and unified approach to understanding environmental issues.\n",

Once I have access to these articles, I will use Pandas to organize the data into an analyzable format.
